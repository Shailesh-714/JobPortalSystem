        <h2>Job Portal System</h2>
        <p>
           A job portal is a website where people who need jobs can find jobs and companies looking for job seekers can find the perfect employees. 
            It serves as a medium where job seekers can create profiles, upload resumes, and search for job openings across various industries and locations.
            Employers, on the other hand, can post job vacancies, review applicant profiles, and conduct the initial stages of the hiring process through the portal. 
            A well-known job portal is LinkedIn. It lets professionals show what they’re good at, connect with others in their field, and check out job listings from companies.
            It’s a big platform for making work connections and finding jobs<br><br>
